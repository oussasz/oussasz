##  How Did I End Up Here?  🤷‍♂️
Honestly, I'm **not a programmer**—I just have some work to do, and somehow, I landed here.  
I write **just enough code to get things done**, then I’m out! 
I didn’t choose coding. Coding chose me… and I’m still trying to escape. 😆  

##  Who Am I?
-  **Industrial Maintenance Engineer 🔧** – Passionate about keeping machines (and ideas) running smoothly.  
-  **Curious Innovator 💡** – I turn wild ideas into projects… sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t! 🤷‍♂️  
-  **Accidental Coder 💻** – coding with pure hope and AI magic.  
-  **Entrepreneurial Mindset 🚀** – Always experimenting with new startup ideas.
-  **Open to Collaborations 🤝 ** – I have **some unfinished projects in private repos**… maybe you can help?

## 🐧 Why Linux?  
Because why use Windows when you can **suffer elegantly**? 😆

🔥 **Fun Fact:** My code works… until I run it. Then, reality hits. 😆
