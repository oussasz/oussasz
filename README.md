##  My Journey to Code 🌟
I’m not a programmer by trade, but I’ve learned to wield code as a tool to bring my ideas to life. As an Industrial Maintenance Engineer, I’m wired to solve problems and innovate—sometimes that means diving into code with curiosity, grit, and a little AI magic. Coding didn’t choose me; I chose to mess it up..

## Current Projects 🚧 
### MaintaFOX - GMAO
a web-based self hosted application designed as a CMMS aims to provide industrial maintenance prosses. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtime, and optimize maintenance workflows.
**Technology Stack:**
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Authentication:** JWT

**Project Status:** This is currently a prototype under active development.


### VibraFOX:
A **desktop application** for vibration analysis, utilizing a **basic yet functional algorithm** to extract insights from mechanical signals. While it may not be state-of-the-art, it serves as a practical foundation for further development.Currently private—not because it’s a top-secret innovation, but to spare myself from the laughter of seasoned programmers. It’s my first serious project, and I’d rather debug in peace before facing the critics! 😆
